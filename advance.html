The first week at IIT was spent in orientation; it gave us an idea what the culture is all about. The academics at IIT are just a small part of it, there's a lot more to IIT beyond academics. This was very clear during the orientation, when all the different departments, like cultural activities group, sports activity group, introduced us to the activities and things we can learn and practice at college.

In this sense, the message is clear from IIT that you're not here only for studies and you need to explore all the opportunities you get. So itâ€™s up to you, the college provides all the opportunities, it completely depends on you how much you want to use those to grow.</h2>
