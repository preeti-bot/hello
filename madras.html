        <h1 style="color: crimson; font-weight: bolder;text-align: center;">IIT MADRAS</h1>
        <h2 style="color: black;text-align: center;">Chennai: Studying in IIT is like a dream to many. While some clear the entrance exam for the prestigious institutes in a single attempt, others have a hard time getting through. With the limited number of seats, getting into an IIT is one of toughest tasks you could take on in your teens. But is it really worth all the effort?

            Does an Indian Institute of Technology or say the top IIT of all, IIT-Madras (listed as best engineering college in India by NIRF), is what the students expect? How is an IIT different from other institutes in India?
            
            India Today Education spent two days in IIT-Madras to get the answers for all the brimming questions, not just from the professors but the students themselves.
            
            With our interaction with Poojan Patel, who is in the fifth year of a dual degree program in Civil Engineering, and Vineesha Badabhagni, who is in the final year of BTech in electrical engineering, along with a few other students on campus, we have got our hands on some important information you would like to know.</h2>

<li> Festival of IIT Madras</li>
<ul><li>Shaastra</li><p>True to its name, the Sanskrit equivalent of science, Shaastra is a celebration of unconstrained thinking and love for the spirit of engineering. A melting pot of diverse disciplines in science, it provides the opportunity to catch a glimpse of the latest worldwide trending technologies.</p><p>Shaastra has always been a tremendous learning experience for the organisers, participants and visitors. The fest attracts an immense number of participants from diverse technical, scientific and managerial backgrounds, from school students to graduates, academicians to professionals, engineers to entrepreneurs. Shaastra also has something to offer to non-hardcore techies, with events such as drone wars, laser shows and firework displays that make up a huge part of the Shows and Exhibitions every year</p>
<li>Saarang</li><p>IIT Madras has seen a 60-year journey marked by many milestones, one of which was the advent of Mardi Gras, a pioneer student cultural extravaganza. Mardi Gras had the distinction of hosting Uriah Heep (in one of their rare world tours), Buddha’s Babies and even A R Rahman as a college student. Almost 45 years later, the legacy lives on, but now known as Saarang.

    One of the largest cultural festivals in India, Saarang attracts over 50,000 people from around the country. Held in January every year, Saarang is commonly acknowledged as the mother of all cultural festivals, a reputation that the Institute is honour-bound to uphold.</p>

<li> Other Facilities</li><p>Schools: There are two schools located inside the campus, viz. Kendriya Vidyalaya IIT, located between GC and the IITM Post Office and Vanavani Matriculation Higher Secondary School, located within the residential zone.</p><p>Open Air Theatre: In between the Gajendra Circle and the hostel zone, you will spot a large arena called the Open Air Theatre, where the Film Club screens weekend movies. Here, the best new movies in English, Hindi, Tamil and other regional languages are screened. The OAT is also where the Saarang Pro-shows are held.</p>
<p>Places of Worship: The lush IIT Madras campus houses a number of places of worship.

    There are three temples on campus. The Shree Durga Peeli Amman Temple on Delhi Avenue is the site of processions during Navratri.

    There is a chapel behind the Department of Biotechnology, easily located on Sunday mornings by following the sound of choir music. Having recently turned six, the chapel conducts Mass and other activities like ‘intercession of prayers’ where handwritten, anonymous prayers are distributed among members, who then pray for the one they have received. </p>
